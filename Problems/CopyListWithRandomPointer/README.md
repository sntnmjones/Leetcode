# Copy List With Random Pointer
The description is makes it sound worse than it is. We can solve this using a map of old nodes to new nodes. Looping twice as the new nodes don't exist yet, so they'll need to be created and inserted in the table. Looping through a second time, we can assign the pointers to their proper Nodes.
