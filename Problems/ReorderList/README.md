# Reorder List
Use [Fast and Slow Pointers](../../Concepts/linkedlist.md#fast-and-slow-pointers) to split the original list in half.  
[Reverse](../../Concepts/linkedlist.md#reverse-a-linked-list) the second half of the list.  
Merge the two halves  
```python
nums = [0,1,2,3,4]

listA = [0,1]
listB = [4,3,2]

newList = [0,4,1,3,2]
```
